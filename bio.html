			<h3>My Bio</h3>
				<!--self description, major, why this major-->
				<ol>
					My name is Emily Vivian, I'm 23 and a super senior at Eastern Washington University. I'm a VCD major because it's the greatest major out there, obviouslly. I love the masterpieces out of the bare minimum, and fixing things that have already been created. My first major at EWU was Business Marketing; my second was Computer Science, but I found my passion in Visual Communications and Design. Before my illustrious career behind a computer screen I was an avid athlete. I started figure skating at 4 years old, started ballet not too long after that.
